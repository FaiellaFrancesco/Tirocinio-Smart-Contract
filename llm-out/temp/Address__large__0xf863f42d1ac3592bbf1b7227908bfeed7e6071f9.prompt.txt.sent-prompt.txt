 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

-### Instructions:
- Use **ethers.js v5** and **Chai** for testing.
- Import ethers from "ethers".

  - **Deployment**: Verify correct initialization and constructor state.
  - **Happy paths**: Normal usage for every public or external function.
  - **Reverts**: Test invalid inputs, unauthorized access, and failure conditions.
  - **Events**: Verify that events are emitted with correct parameters using `.to.emit()`.
  - **Edge cases**: Test cases like zero values, address(0), max integers, empty strings, etc.


### Output:
Your output should include **only valid, executable TypeScript test code** (`.spec.ts` format). The code should be complete and ready to execute with Hardhat.

### Test Requirements:
- Use **ethers.js v5** (specifically `ethers.utils` and `ethers.constants`).
- Ensure all test functions are structured clearly:
  - **State-modifying functions**: Test changes to contract state.
  - **Getter and setter functions**: Ensure getters return the correct value and setters correctly modify state.
  - **Pure and view functions**: Ensure that state is not modified and the correct values are returned.
  - **Access control functions**: Verify that only authorized accounts (e.g., owner, specific roles) can call functions with appropriate access control.
  - **Event emission**: Verify the correct emission of events with proper arguments, using `.to.emit()`.
  - **Error handling**: Ensure functions revert with appropriate error messages on invalid inputs.
  - **Edge cases**: Handle boundary conditions, such as `address(0)`, maximum integers, and empty strings.

---

### Example Test:

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

describe("ContractName", function () {
  it("should return the correct owner", async function () {
    const [owner, addr1] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("ContractName");
    const contract = await Contract.deploy();
    await contract.deployed();
    
    expect(await contract.owner()).to.equal(owner.address);
  });

  it("should revert on invalid address", async function () {
    const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("ContractName");
    const contract = await Contract.deploy();
    await contract.deployed();

    await expect(
      contract.airdrop("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", 1)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Invalid address");
  });
});
