 * Auto-generated scaffold for SafeMath.
 * ARTIFACT_SOURCE: contracts/0x00148d918311aa2c363f752d45b57cff9200cff0.sol
 * ARTIFACT_PATH: 0x00148d918311aa2c363f752d45b57cff9200cff0.sol/SafeMath.json
 * ARTIFACT_FQN: contracts/0x00148d918311aa2c363f752d45b57cff9200cff0.sol:SafeMath
 *
 * FUNCTIONS:
 *   (none)
 *
 * EVENTS:
 *   (none)
 *
 * LLM NOTES (follow strictly):
 * - Remove this.skip() and fill TODO_AI blocks when implementing tests.
 * - Use Ethers v6 (no ethers.utils), bigint literals, ethers.ZeroAddress.
 * - View/Pure: assert return values. State-changing: happy path + revert + boundary.
 * - Do NOT introduce functions that are not listed above.
